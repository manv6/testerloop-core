# Testerloop

This repo will guide you through the installation of Testerloop in your project. Testerloop is comprised of three primary components.

1. Testerloop App
2. Testerloop CLI
3. Testerloop Cypress Reporter Plugin

## Testerloop App

To begin with you can install the App, which is a web application that will allow you to view your test results. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the repo [here](https://github.com/testerloop/testerloop-app/tree/open-source). 

_#TODO - this currently points to the `open-source` branch, but will be updated to `main` once the app is open sourced._

## Testerloop CLI

The Testerloop CLI is a command line tool that will allow you to run your tests and send the results to the Testerloop App. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the repo [here](https://github.com/testerloop/testerloop-cli/tree/multitenant). 

_#TODO - this currently points to the `multitenant` branch, but will be updated to `main` once the app is open sourced._

## Testerloop Cypress Reporter Plugin

The Testerloop Cypress Reporter Plugin is a plugin for Cypress that will record the output and results of your Cypress tests and upload them to S3 for viewing in the Testerloop App. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the repo [here](https://github.com/testerloop/cypress-reporter-plugin/tree/multitenant). 

_#TODO - this currently points to the `multitenant` branch, but will be updated to `main` once the app is open sourced._
